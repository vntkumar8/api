### CSV
Sometimes, having files in a spreadsheet format is more useful for analysts and scientists. We have provided the files as downloadable csv files as below.

## Files available :
Latest data (10-20 minutes delayed) is available through the `latest` end-point.
These are the files available

## Notes
- raw_data3 includes confirmed, recovered and deceased entries. They can be distinguised based on the "Current Status" key
- If you need to get the full raw_data, you need to :
   * Append raw_data1, raw_data2, make all "Current Status" to 'Hospitalized'
   * Append death_and_recovered1, death_and_recovered2 intelligently to the above
   * Add a 'Num_Cases' column with all values 1
   * Append raw_data3 below this
- We will try to do this data wrangling and provide a one true raw_data soon. If anybody can create the script for doing this, PRs are welcome :)

## How to
If you prefer working on a Google Sheet instead of downloading the files and would like the data to reflect the latest version - below is an example to live fetch this CSV to a spreadsheet.
> :rocket: Quick example : Apply the formula `=IMPORTDATA("https://api.covid19india.org/csv/latest/state_wise.csv")` in A1 cell of a Google Sheets to get the state data for analysis :)
