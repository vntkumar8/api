A volunteer-driven, crowdsourced database for COVID-19 stats & patient tracing in India

## About Raw Data

Due to the growing size of the raw data, and the fact that regions like DL, MH, TG are only providing district level information, we have made a change in our data collection.
Now, raw data is available in three parts :

`api.covid19india.org/raw_data1.json` (Data till EoD Apr 19th)<br>
`api.covid19india.org/raw_data2.json` (Data till EoD Apr 26th)<br>
`api.covid19india.org/raw_data3.json` (Data till EoD May 09th)<br>
`api.covid19india.org/raw_data4.json` (Data till EoD May 23rd)<br>
`api.covid19india.org/raw_data5.json` (Live ðŸš€)<br>

Also, there are some structural difference since raw_data3.json :
When a new report/bulletin is released from a state regarding confirmed cases :

1. If patient level information is available (from several states like KA,KL,BH etc.), that is captured.
2. If only districtwise information is available, one row is entered for each district, and "numcases" field mentions the number of cases in that district
3. If only statewise information is available, one row is added added for the entire state (DL ðŸ‘€)

4. Recoveries and Deceased information is also available through raw_data3.json now. Use the "Current Status" field to extract that information.

All other aggregate APIs retain the same behaviour.
CSV files for the same are also available through `api.covid19india.org/csv/latest/raw_data{n}.csv`

We are working on providing a singular raw_data that can be the source of truth. However, we strongly advise you to use the aggrgate information for any analysis.

### CSV

Sometimes, having files in a spreadsheet format is more useful for analysts and scientists. We have provided the files as downloadable csv files in the following location.

| Data                 | URL                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google sheets in CSV | [https://api.covid19india.org/csv/](https://api.covid19india.org/csv/) |

> :rocket: Quick example : Apply the formula `=IMPORTDATA("https://api.covid19india.org/csv/latest/state_wise.csv")` in A1 cell of a Google Sheets to get the state data for analysis :)


### Alternate API's by Contributors
API for current cases, statewise, districtwise and historical data of India COVID-19
- Graphql playground - https://covidstat.info/graphql [API documentation](https://github.com/COVID19-SARS-CoV-2/web-covid-api/blob/master/india_apis.md)

## How this works

- Data in this repository is generated from Google Sheets (https://api.covid19india.org/csv)
- Volunteers collect data from trusted sources and update the sheet
- We use Github Actions to fetch the data from the sheet to the repo periodically.
- Static json and csv files into the gh-pages repository

## Contributing

- Contributions to new data formats are welcome. Please create a GH issue and discuss there before working on the same.
- Please raise an issue before submitting a PR
- Report issues regarding [covid19india.org](https://www.covid19india.org) website in the [react-site repository](https://github.com/covid19india/covid19india-react/issues)
- DO NOT change anything in `gh-pages` branch directly.They get replaced automatically
